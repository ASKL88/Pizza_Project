# Pizza_Project

This Pizza Project created a website that takes user input for a pizza order. Using HTML and CSS, the website presents a menu with three customizations to choose from: Size, Vegetables, Meats. The Size column is a button selector, and the two other columns are checkboxes. The user can select their pizza customizations and press the place order button. Using JavaScript, the ordered items will be listed along with the total price.
